# Author local v1 mini apps

Do not display “Saved,” “Saving…,” or routine persistence indicators inside authored slops. The native host owns save-failure and retry UI. Use task-specific feedback for explicit operations, such as “Importing skin…” or “Skin applied.”

Read manifest.json first; only runtime hitslop-v1 is supported. Contract 4 / ABI 2 uses schema.ts with defineDocument/s, initial.ts and theme.ts. The trial supports s.text, s.boolean, s.object, s.list(s.object) and integer s.counter. Other descriptors reject explicitly until their core and SDK coverage lands. Keep transient view state in $state.

Components call `const doc = useDocument(schema)`. Read immutable `doc.current`; ordinary handles return promises: `await doc.at(row).done.set(true)` and `const {id} = await doc.fields.items.insert(...)`. `list.item(id)` addresses a row directly. `await doc.change(tx => { ... })` collects synchronous tx writes once into one atomic batch; tx insert returns an ID immediately for later tx writes. Do not use async/nested collectors or ordinary document writes inside them. A write resolves after acceptance and local publication, before durability or necessarily a DOM update; use `await tick()` for the DOM and `await doc.flush()` for saving.

`bindText` maintains local Unicode drafts and composition; `bindValue` submits booleans asynchronously. Boolean previews stay local until set/flush. Flush drains drafts, previews and writes; unfinished composition blocks close/export. Keep composer input until insert succeeds, preserve newer input, and display success notices only after acceptance. Handle rejected promises; the runtime reports command failures centrally. The host owns save-failure and retry UI.

Never replace an existing identity-bearing list through a containing object. Use insert/remove/move. Counter decrement is increment(-n); there is no concurrent reset API. Checkpoints retain history.

Swift owns the native Rust Loro core; WebViews receive snapshots and patches. Browser development uses the same Rust core compiled to WASM. Do not embed the engine into app bundles or expose a second JSON writer. Build emits state.schema.json (a descriptor), initial.json, assets (including the app module assets/app.js, generated from App.svelte and styles.css) and document guidance. The host owns the page; apps reach it only through the document SDK. Never include state/, stores/, source, dependencies or caches in templates.

Start anywhere with `bunx @hitslop/cli init NAME`, then `cd NAME` and `bun install`. Use the generated `bun run check/dev/build/register` scripts. Bun is the only JavaScript runtime required; build/register need the compatible installed hitSlop Mac app, not Swift or Xcode. Preview state is disposable; rerun dev to rebuild source. Create a writable copy of a built/registered template before editing. Agents use schema/get/apply/batch/compact. Pre-v1 documents are rejected without migration; preserve supported v1 contracts.

For an agent already doing the work, use `init NAME --yes --brief 'What to build'`,
optionally with `--author`, `--title`, `--description`, and one or two `--category`
flags. `--slug` overrides the directory-derived slug. Metadata is validated before
any project files are created. `--yes`, CI, and non-TTY runs never prompt or launch
another agent. For humans, setup asks for a build brief and author, then offers
a detected agent CLI, Other CLI, or Finish without launching. Title, description,
and categories start as placeholders: set them in manifest.json to match what you
build; the user can edit them later. The chosen agent
runs in the project with normal permissions and reads `BRIEF.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
Launch failure keeps the project. Read the brief before adapting the starter.

`slop skills install` adds selected guides and agent links; `skills repair`
repairs existing links, and `skills uninstall` explicitly removes owned links.
Bare `skills` means install; `skills update` remains an alias for repair. The
guides copied into a new project's `.agents/skills` are portable files, not
managed links, and must be reviewed manually when upgrading the project.

Quick Checklist is the active trial example; other slops are archived; additional projects are discovered under examples/slops and bundled selection lives in bundled.json. Use plain CSS and defineTheme tokens and each app's own visual identity. Read the bundled hitslop-design references for CSS, presentation, and capture. PNG/PDF export is supported; hosted publishing and catalog are deferred.

Use `<Slop>` from `@hitslop/document/svelte`; optional inline exportView and icon snippets mount only during capture. Keep markup together in App.svelte unless a separate component helps. Build/register generate Quick Look artwork through the native helper, without bundling Loro. Register backs up and replaces an existing stateless master only after a successful complete build.

`<Slop>` takes no document prop. Child components call `useDocument(schema)` for the same document; in long lists, pass rows and handles as props instead.

Read [the workflow](references/workflow.md) and [package boundaries](references/storage-and-packages.md) for the complete source-to-document path.

Use `attachments` from `@hitslop/document/attachments` for portable binary files.
`await attachments.import(file, { commit: ref => doc.change(tx => { /* typed reference fields */ }) })`
waits for durable bytes, accepted reference edits and persistence. `read(id)` returns
a Blob; `list()` returns IDs and sizes. References are ordinary schema scalars,
never base64 document values. Validate app formats first. Limits: 10 MiB/file,
100 MiB and 256 files/document. HTTPS data/media requests are allowed; CORS applies.

Keep high-frequency or transient values (drag positions, playback, timers) in local state or `handle.preview()`, not saved fields; use attachments for binary data. Documents are capped at 32 MiB.
Counter values read `number | null`: `null` flags invalid stored contributions or merged overflow; render it as unavailable and disable increments.
