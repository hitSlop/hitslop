# Source, templates, and documents

Source contains the manifest, TypeScript descriptor definition, initial values,
theme tokens, components, and plain CSS. Build compiles immutable app.html/assets,
state.schema.json, initial.json, runtime requirements, and document guidance.
Native capture adds QuickLook artwork. Templates contain no mutable state,
source, dependencies, caches, or stores.

Creating a writable copy adds state/document.sqlite and ownership files. Loro
in WebKit owns live data; Swift persists opaque bytes. Initial values seed only
a new document. Never reconcile JSON files into state or edit SQLite directly.
Use typed handles or the native CLI; `flush()` acknowledges persistence.

state/theme.json contains bounded declared-token overrides. Use theme commands,
not arbitrary CSS. Close before moving documents; synced folders are unsupported.
Shipped v1 runtime contracts remain supported; pre-v1 formats are not migrated.

Optional `state/attachments/<sha256>` files hold opaque imported bytes. Only the
host attachment API/CLI writes them, under existing ownership. References belong
to Loro; templates remain free of mutable state. Duplicate/export snapshots copy
attachments. Close/export flush accepted imports before proceeding.
