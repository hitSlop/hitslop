# Author a mini app

A slop does one understandable job. Start with the user's primary action, the information they need at a glance, and what completion looks like. Each template owns its identity; shared infrastructure does not prescribe a collection-wide appearance.

## Start and iterate

In this checkout, use `bun slop dev examples/slops/quick-checklist`, `bun slop build SOURCE`, and `bun slop register SOURCE`. Repository contributors should follow [development](development.md) for runtime/helper preparation and adding templates.

For the distributed tools, install Bun and the matching Mac app, then:

```sh
bunx @hitslop/cli init my-slop
cd my-slop
bun install
bun run dev
```

Interactive setup collects a build brief and author, then asks which agent CLI
should implement the slop. The agent sets the manifest title, description, and
categories to match what it builds. Choose a detected agent, enter another
installed CLI, or finish without launching. `BRIEF.md` and `AGENTS.md` carry the
handoff. Use `--yes` and explicit metadata flags for unattended creation; CI and
non-TTY runs never launch an agent. See [CLI workflows](cli.md#create-preview-and-register-an-app)
for flag examples, defaults, and skill installation.

CLI 1.2.0 uses document/schema SDK 1.1.0 and works with Mac 1.0.7. Generated projects pin the CLI and its required SDK separately; these package versions need not be equal. Prefer their `bun run check/dev/build/register` scripts. Native capture requires the installed Mac app or an explicit `HITSLOP_NATIVE_CLI`; authoring never compiles Swift. Browser preview needs no native renderer.

Read `manifest.json` first. Set `runtime` to `hitslop-v1`, author, slug, title, description, one or two categories, and initial presentation. Define `schema.ts`, creation-only `initial.ts`, token defaults in `theme.ts`, and UI in `App.svelte`. No entry file is needed: the build mounts `App.svelte` with `styles.css` through `defineSlop`. A non-Svelte app supplies `main.ts` exporting `default { mount(ctx, target) }`; see the [runtime reference](../reference/runtime.md). Apps never import the runtime or call the host bridge.

Preview state is disposable: refresh resets it and source changes require restarting dev. Build emits `dist/<slug>.slop`. Registration builds a complete immutable master under `~/.hitslop/templates`, backing up a previous master outside the catalog before replacement. Create a writable copy in the Mac app to test persistence. Source, template, and writable document are distinct objects.

## Model state

The contract-4 trial supports `text`, `boolean`, `object`, `list(object)` and exact integer `counter`. Strings, bounded numbers, enums, optionals, records, scalar lists, trees and rich text are deferred and explicitly rejected by the core.

```ts
import { defineDocument, s } from "@hitslop/document";
export default defineDocument({
  title: s.text(),
  tasks: s.list(s.object({ text: s.text(), done: s.boolean() })),
  cups: s.counter(),
});
```

Use text for typed content, booleans for flags, lists for identity-bearing rows, and counters for increments. Counter snapshots can be `null` after an invalid merged contribution or overflow; show the issue and disable increments. Give initial fields explicit values. `initial.json` is creation-only. A schema change needs a new document.

Components call `useDocument(schema)`. Read immutable `doc.current`; write through typed handles:

```ts
await doc.at(task).done.set(!task.done);
const { id } = await doc.fields.tasks.insert({ text: "New task", done: false });
await doc.fields.tasks.item(id).text.replace("Revised task");
await doc.fields.cups.decrement(); // increment(-1), not a reset
await doc.change(tx => {
  for (const task of finished) tx.at(task).done.set(true);
});
```

Ordinary writes resolve after acceptance and local publication. They do not promise disk durability or DOM rendering. Use `await doc.flush()` for durability and Svelte `tick()` when an action depends on rendering. Preserve composer input while a command is pending and show success notices only after acceptance. A rejection leaves the confirmed snapshot unchanged and is reported centrally.

`doc.change` invokes its synchronous collector once. Its `tx` handles collect one atomic batch. They return immediately, so an inserted ID can be addressed later in the same callback. Throwing, returning a promise, nesting `change`, using ordinary document writes inside the callback, or using escaped transaction handles rejects. `doc.current` remains the pre-batch snapshot until acceptance. The optional message is currently advisory and is not persisted as history metadata.

`doc.at(value)` accepts an original snapshot object, including a row or nested object. `doc.fields.tasks.item(id)` provides the by-ID handle. Key rows by `$id`, never array position. Unchanged snapshots retain object identity. Edit identity-bearing lists through insert/remove/move; containing-object replacement is not supported.

Use `bindText` for plain text inputs and `bindValue` for boolean controls. Text drafts preserve Unicode, selection and composition ancestry. Close/export refuse while composition is active. Boolean `preview(value)` stays local until set/flush; a failed commit retains the preview. Save failures retain accepted edits and ownership for native retry. Never write SQLite or maintain a second JSON document.

Keep transient UI state in Svelte `$state`. Every component's `useDocument(schema)` shares the mounted app adapter; removing one consumer does not disconnect the others.

## Attachments and HTTPS

In interactive native windows, standard `<input type="file">` controls open a
document-attached file picker. Cancellation leaves the document unchanged.
Background rendering and closed CLI commands never present file pickers. Validate
the selected file in authored code before storing it.

Keep the document for state worth saving. High-frequency or transient values (drag positions, playback progress, timers, hover state) belong in local component state or `handle.preview()`, which commits only at flush; writing them on every frame grows history for no benefit. Store binary data as attachments, never inside fields. Stored checkpoint plus updates are capped at 32 MiB; a failed save retains live edits and leaves the last durable representation intact.

Import `attachments` from `@hitslop/document/attachments`. Save a browser File with
`await attachments.import(file, { commit: ref => doc.change(tx => { /* store ref.id using supported fields */ }) })`.
The callback runs after durable blob storage and must return its document-write promise. Submit the reference change synchronously in the callback; perform asynchronous file preparation before calling import. The import promise also waits for document durability. Failed blob storage never submits the reference; a rejected reference edit leaves an unreferenced immutable blob. An accepted reference whose save fails remains in the native owner for retry. References contain `id`, `name`, `mimeType`, and `byteLength`.
Model them with ordinary scalar/object schema fields. Never put binary/base64
payloads in Loro. Validate app-specific formats before importing.

`attachments.read(id, { type: ref.mimeType })` returns a typed Blob; revoke any object URLs you create.
`attachments.list()` returns stored IDs and sizes, including unused blobs.
The native owner manages `state/attachments/`, deduplicated by SHA-256, with limits
of 10 MiB per file, 100 MiB and 256 unique files per document. Removing a reference
does not delete bytes; garbage collection is deferred. Filenames and MIME types
are descriptive metadata in the document, never filesystem paths.

Close/export/reload/duplication flush accepted imports. Disk failures remain in
native retry. Preview uses disposable memory storage with identical limits.
Templates contain no imported attachments.

Slops may fetch HTTPS data and play HTTPS media without manifest declarations.
Images may use HTTPS, data or blob URLs. CORS remains enforced; remote scripts
and JavaScript eval stay blocked. Bundle executable code locally.

## Design and styling

Quick Checklist and Small Expenses are current examples, not a limit or a default visual style. Start new templates from their own purpose. Paper, Instrument, and Skin are optional directions. `_vibe/` is inspiration only; never ship its images. Record product context in PRODUCT.md and each object's actual palette, typography, layout, state language, and motion in its DESIGN.md.

Make the purpose visible in the first viewport. Keep controls familiar, state readable through words and structure, and essential text comfortable. Start with realistic content at manifest dimensions; remove competing elements before shrinking labels. Aim for at least 12px supporting text, 14px control labels, and 44px action targets. Provide keyboard access, visible focus, sufficient contrast, and reduced-motion behavior.

Use plain CSS, with app-prefixed classes and related states/descendants kept together. Style Bits UI primitives through their supported attributes; give portal content explicit classes because it lives outside the trigger's ancestor tree. Define public tokens with `defineTheme` from `@hitslop/document/theme` and use `var(--slop-TOKEN)`. The builder writes immutable defaults to `assets/theme.json` and compiled app styling to `assets/app.css`. The runtime applies defaults and overrides before mounting the app, so no separate theme stylesheet is generated. Owners use `slop theme get/set/reset`; the host writes overrides to `state/theme.json`. Never edit these built files directly. Layout changes require authoring source and a rebuild.

Motion should explain change and settle for capture. Persist target values immediately, stop transient work on unmount, and honor reduced motion. Export hooks must not mutate saved state to prepare a view.

## Window presentation

Standard windows use initial width/height, optional `resizable` (default true), and optional `shape` (`rounded`, `ellipse`, or `capsule`). Width is 240–4096px; height is 180–4096px. Use fluid outer layouts and test initial and narrower dimensions. In native windows, unskinned apps can request `globalThis.slop.window.resize({ width, height })`; the host returns the applied size. The manifest remains the initial size. This host global is not a removed runtime-package import and is unavailable in disposable browser preview.

The window is the stage in every mode. The host resets `html`/`body` margins and makes them, `<Slop>`'s root, and its mount ancestors fill the window; framework-neutral apps mark their root `data-hitslop-root`. Size your shell with `height: 100%`, grid, or flex, and scroll inside panes or the root. Prefer these defaults over repeated `html`/`body` sizing or `100vh`; override deliberately when the layout requires it. The sizing rules have zero specificity, so deliberate overrides still work. Native owns the silhouette: built-in shapes and skin PNGs mask the window, so keep controls inside the visible shape (`data-slop-shape` is set for padding). For transparency, set `background: "transparent"` with a built-in shape; transparent and skin windows override ordinary `html`/`body` backgrounds, so draw the visible surface in your app and avoid more-specific or `!important` page backgrounds that defeat that transparency. Capture disables the sizing rules, so export and icon views use normal flow. `slop dev` previews the same stage at the manifest size, with the shape or skin mask.

| Host value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `data-slop-presentation` | `standard`, `transparent`, or `skin` |
| `data-slop-shape` | Built-in shape, absent for PNG skins |
| `data-slop-resizable` | Present when user resizing is enabled |
| `--slop-width`, `--slop-height` | Initial dimensions, not live viewport measurements |
| `data-slop-controls` | Optional `visible` / `hidden` signal matching the native hover toolbar |

These presentation values are supplied by the native host. Use actual viewport layout in preview rather than assuming native masks or host globals exist there. Move windows with the native toolbar handle; no guest drag API or drag attribute exists.

For strictly hover-only actions, follow `html[data-slop-controls="visible"]` in CSS.
The host initializes this attribute to `hidden` and updates it with the native toolbar,
including its pointer hit testing, toolbar interactions, and 0.8-second hide delay.
Focus, Tab, and a disabled control do not reveal or retain these actions. Hide the
controls with `visibility: hidden` and `pointer-events: none`, not opacity alone,
so they are also absent from keyboard navigation while hidden. The attribute is
transient presentation state, not document data or a JavaScript event API.

Browser previews and older hosts may omit the attribute. Use
`html:not([data-slop-controls]) .your-shell:hover .your-controls` as the CSS fallback;
do not let that fallback override an explicit native `hidden` value. Continue to
mark editing controls `data-slop-export="hide"`, or omit them from an export view.

Use a PNG skin only when built-in shapes cannot express the outline or hole. `presentation` then contains only width, height, and `skin: "assets/window-mask.png"`. The RGBA image must exactly match those dimensions; the window cannot resize. Alpha 0–25 is click-through and 26–255 receives input. Keep controls/focus rings away from feathered edges and verify clicks actually reach the desktop through holes. Browser transparency alone does not reproduce native hit testing.

## Export and icons

Keep editor, export, and icon markup together unless a separate component helps:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slop, useDocument, bindText } from "@hitslop/document/svelte";
  import schema from "./schema";
  const doc = useDocument(schema);
</script>
<Slop>
  <input aria-label="Title" use:bindText={doc.fields.title} />
  {#snippet exportView()}
    <article><h1>{doc.current.title}</h1></article>
  {/snippet}
  {#snippet icon()}<div class="icon">✓</div>{/snippet}
</Slop>
```

`<Slop>` reads the host document from context, reports rendering failures, flushes before capture, and mounts snippets lazily against the same document. It requires an app mounted by the host through `defineSlop`; no document prop is needed. Nested wrappers for multiple documents are unsupported. Preview/PNG/PDF use `exportView` when supplied, otherwise the editor. Without an icon snippet, the host uses its generic icon.

Rendering failures in export or icon snippets reject that capture without replacing the editor or reporting an application-render error. Restoration clears the snippet failure so a later attempt renders it again. Editor rendering failures still use native application-error recovery and prevent capture.

Child components can call `useDocument(schema)` during initialization for typed access to the same host document, including inside export and icon snippets. Every call returns the mounted app's shared adapter, not another subscription or engine. For repeated list components, still pass reactive rows and typed handles as props rather than rereading the whole document per row.

Dedicated exports should use normal flow, not fixed viewport heights or nested scrolling. With `exportView`, the editor is never captured. Without one, mark editing-only controls `data-slop-export="hide"`; fallback capture renders native text inputs as wrapping text. `<Slop>` centers icon art in a transparent 512px square with a strong silhouette and safe margins. Dedicated exports do not inherit native masks.

Framework-neutral apps may use `capture.registerTarget("export" | "icon", { element, prepare, restore })`; targets must be direct body children. `capture.onPrepare` supports asynchronous readiness. Dispose registrations and do not mutate durable state. Capture waits for fonts, visible images, and stable layout, blocks edits, and restores editor focus/selection/scroll on success or failure.

PNG is 2×, limited to 16,384 pixels per side and 24 megapixels. PDF preserves searchable text/vectors on one full-length page with a maximum 14,400-point dimension. Build/register render disposable copies and generate Quick Look artwork without leaving mutable state in masters. Close refreshes the preview and Finder icon metadata; immutable `QuickLook/Icon.png` remains unchanged.

Live exports capture the selected view at current width; closed exports use saved state and the app's initial view. See [CLI export](cli.md#export) and [runtime capture details](../reference/runtime.md#capture-and-finder-integration).

## Review a complete object

Review empty, typical, long-content, failed, and busy states; keyboard/IME interaction; reduced motion; initial/narrow widths; theme overrides; and open overlays. Use normal controls for temporary review data rather than changing creation defaults.

Run check/build, register, create a writable copy, type then immediately close, reopen, duplicate, and export PNG/PDF. Inspect editor, export, and icon from the same revision. Native tests are required for persistence, clipping, skins, and desktop click-through. See [presentation fixtures](development.md#focused-checks) and the packaged [design skill](../../packages/cli/skills/hitslop-design/SKILL.md).
