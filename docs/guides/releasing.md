# Release the Mac app and npm packages

Launch includes the signed/notarized Apple silicon Mac app and matching `@hitslop/schema`, `@hitslop/document`, and `@hitslop/cli` packages. Hosted template publication, catalog services, accounts, and collaboration remain deferred. npm publication is a separate maintainer-run action after the compatible Mac app is available. CLI-only releases may reuse an already shipped compatible app and SDK.

## CLI-only release: 1.2.0

CLI **1.2.0** uses schema/document **1.1.0**, Mac **1.0.7 (25)**, and the existing
sealed runtime contract **1**, revision **2**. Publish only the CLI. Keep SDK and
runtime identities, sealed bytes, historical records, and Mac tags unchanged.

1. Update the CLI version, lockfile, and user-facing commands. Generated projects
   must pin the CLI's exact document dependency independently of the CLI version.
   Confirm the npm version and `cli-vVERSION` tag are unused.
2. Commit the candidate, then run the complete `bun run release:check` on the clean
   commit. Additionally install the exact CLI tarball with registry SDK packages
   outside the checkout and exercise init/install/check/build/register, document
   editing, and PNG/PDF export using the already shipped compatible Mac app.
3. Push master and wait for `fast`, `native`, and the secret scan on that commit.
   Tag it `cli-vVERSION`. This tag does not trigger Mac signing/publication.
4. Create a GitHub Release retaining the tested CLI tarball, `SHA256SUMS`, gate
   report, and `release-record.json`. Record the commit/tag, CLI and dependency
   versions, compatible Mac version, runtime identity/checksum, artifact hashes,
   and installed-app smoke results. Never attach new files to an old Mac release.
5. Verify the retained tarball checksum, then manually publish that exact file
   with `bun publish ./hitslop-cli-VERSION.tgz --access public --tag latest`.
   Do not repack or republish unchanged SDK packages. If publication is interrupted,
   inspect the registry before retrying; never overwrite a published version.
6. Verify fresh `bunx @hitslop/cli@VERSION init smoke --yes` and global `slop`
   consumers, successful generated-project installation without SDK overrides,
   and that default `bunx @hitslop/cli` resolves to the intended version. Retain
   registry integrity and consumer results with release evidence.

For coordinated Mac releases below, package manifests determine each tarball's
version. Release records include `packageVersions`; `runtime.sdkVersion` remains
the SDK provenance. CLI dependency pins must match the released SDK packages.

## Coordinated release sequence

The most recent coordinated release is npm **1.1.0**, paired with Mac **1.0.7 (25)** and tag `macos-v1.0.7`. It adds versioned JSON import with runtime contract **1**, revision **2**. The Mac and npm version sequences are independent. Mac 1.0.6 (24) shipped revision 1; preserve its existing runtime ledger checksum and template specimens.

1. Finish release preparation and commit a clean tree. Check package versions, dependency pins, Apple version/build, and runtime provenance together. Confirm the intended npm versions and Mac tag have not already shipped.
2. Run the complete local gate below on that final commit and record manual acceptance results. A report from a dirty checkout or another commit does not validate the release candidate.
3. Push `master` and wait for `fast`, `native`, and the full-history secret scan to pass for the exact commit. Optionally run the Release macOS workflow manually on `master` as a dry run of the complete gate. Tag that commit `macos-v1.0.7` and push the tag; this triggers `.github/workflows/macos-release.yml`.
4. Monitor signing, notarization, Gatekeeper verification, and GitHub Release publication. Verify downloaded artifacts and complete signed-install/Sparkle acceptance. Retain the release record and checksums.
5. Download and verify the release's tested npm tarballs, then publish schema, document, and CLI in that order using the procedure below. Finish with fresh registry consumer checks.

If a gate fails, fix and validate the candidate before publication. Never move a published release tag or overwrite released artifacts. After partial npm publication, verify registry state and resume only missing packages.

## Validate one commit

Use the pinned Bun release, Xcode, and XcodeGen on macOS:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun install --cwd apps/landing --frozen-lockfile
bun run release:check
```

`bun run hygiene` runs only repository hygiene and does not establish release readiness.

The complete gate checks hygiene; builds runtime, helper, and all active templates; verifies generated contracts, provenance, compatibility, types, and skills; runs JS and native tests with presentation fixtures; exercises relocated helper editing/export and storage crashes; packs/tests npm artifacts outside the checkout without Node; checks/builds the public site; builds/verifies the Apple app; and exercises native process death. Any failure stops the gate. Partial or non-macOS checks are not a complete release gate.

Bundled selection comes from `examples/slops/bundled.json`. Every selected package must be present in the app with no unexpected stale starters. Every package is checked for matching build bytes, valid manifest/schema/initial data, runtime requirements, immutable contents, and preview/icon artwork. Installed create/schema/get/reopen/PNG/PDF checks run on Quick Checklist and Small Expenses. Set `HITSLOP_TEMPLATE_EXHAUSTIVE=1` to run those installed checks on every bundled template. Schema-specific mutation/crash probes use known fixtures separately. Packed consumer tests also compile the public getting-started tutorial; its code is an executable contract.

### CI tiers and caches

Pull requests, master pushes, and manual Runtime contracts runs execute Bun-only `fast` on Ubuntu. Feature-branch pushes do not duplicate PR checks. The always-reporting `native` job uses an in-job path filter; relevant changes run Swift, native helper, fixture rendering and crash checks on macOS. Require both checks in branch protection. The full `release:check` runs once, in the Release macOS workflow: on a tag before signing, or manually as a dry run. See [testing](../testing.md).

CI restores SwiftPM `.build` by toolchain, lockfile and source identity, with a compatible restore prefix. The template cache reuses complete, fingerprinted packages; damaged entries rebuild, compiler/SDK/runtime/renderer inputs, copied document guidance, and inherited TypeScript configuration invalidate entries, CLI routing and unrelated scripts do not, and removed templates are pruned. Misses log their changed inputs. Master pushes keep the release template cache warm for tags. Local and CI template builds default to `.hitslop/template-cache`; `HITSLOP_TEMPLATE_CACHE_DIR` can override the location. `build` prepares the runtime/helper, while `build:templates` prepares the complete artwork corpus. Native PNG/QuickLook rendering remains outside the fast job.

Bundled templates are black boxes: every one compiles, opens and reopens in Bun, then renders PNG/PDF and reopens in the native smoke. Conformance fixtures and native boundary tests cover platform edits, picker cancellation, persistence and exports. Application-specific walkthroughs are removed. The gate retains PNG/PDF evidence without visual snapshot comparison.

`release:check` writes `.hitslop/v1-evidence/release-check.json`, including failed stages. Two fresh compatibility replays must give identical logical state hashes. Review the report and render artifacts; a partial report is not release approval.

### Seal bundled templates as fixtures

After building and validating the candidate, verify its existing runtime seal or seal a new revision with the versioning procedure below. Then preview and explicitly preserve new bundled package bytes:

```sh
bun run fixtures:seal
bun run fixtures:seal --write
bun run test
bun run test:native
bun run test:render
```

The first command only lists new specimens. `--write` adds immutable `tests/compatibility/template-*/` specimens with runtime/source provenance, expected initial state and a package seal. Existing source hashes are skipped; existing destinations are never overwritten. Review and commit the new specimens before validating the final release commit. Ordinary builds and checks never regenerate fixtures. Template specimens need no generated edits: named conformance scenarios own runtime semantics.

Restore all older ledger runtimes with `bun run compatibility:restore` before validating on a fresh checkout. CI supplies an independent previous commit via `HITSLOP_COMPAT_BASE` to detect deleted or rewritten history, including a fixture and its hash changed together.

An app release can reuse an existing sealed runtime; it does not automatically
require a new runtime revision. The release workflow attaches an archive of the
selected runtime even when earlier app releases shipped the same bytes. See the
[runtime directory guide](../../runtimes/README.md) for storage locations and
restoration from GitHub Releases.

Inspect generated changes. Never regenerate preserved compatibility fixtures or rewrite release hashes to mask drift. See [versioning](../versioning.md). For a new runtime revision, run `bun scripts/v1/runtime-release.ts` after compatibility validation and commit the new ledger entry before the final release gate. For an already sealed runtime, this command verifies and archives the same bytes without changing the ledger. Retain `generated/v1/runtime-releases/<contract>-<revision>/` permanently with release artifacts; the tagged workflow includes it in the GitHub Release. Restore historical releases for cross-revision tests. Ordinary builds do not seal releases. Validate the final commit, push master and wait for CI, then tag that exact commit. The release workflow rejects an unsealed runtime or a tag that disagrees with the Apple project version.

## Package the Mac app

The deployment target is macOS 14+ on Apple silicon. App version/build values live in `apps/apple/project.yml`. Existing TCA features, local catalog, native windows/toolbar, Analytics/Crashlytics, Sparkle, and NativeCLI remain part of release.

```sh
scripts/install-macos-release.sh
scripts/package-macos-release.sh
bun scripts/v1/release-artifact.ts /path/to/hitSlop.app
```

Embedding ships the native executable and its HitSlopWasm resource bundle. The retired HitSlopRuntime placeholder resource bundle is not required. Verification checks matching host/helper runtime catalogs and exercises installed helpers with a system-only PATH, including PNG/PDF. Native editing needs no checkout, Node, or Bun. `HITSLOP_NATIVE_CLI` selects an explicit matching helper for authoring verification.

Developer ID, notarization, provisioning, App Store Connect, and Sparkle private keys remain outside Git. The tagged GitHub workflow runs the gate once (`release:check --skip-app`), then archives one Release app. `package-macos-release.sh` runs host-crash acceptance on that signed app before notarizing (it needs the Debug helper from `bun run build`; `HITSLOP_SKIP_ACCEPTANCE=1` skips it). The workflow then verifies DMG/ZIP artifacts and publishes the Mac release. It does not publish npm packages. Release the exact tested commit.

The workflow checks these repository secrets before installing/building: `MACOS_CERTIFICATE`, `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`, `ASC_API_KEY_ID`, `ASC_API_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_API_KEY_P8`, and `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY`. Their presence does not establish certificate validity or account access; signing and notarization must succeed. Temporary certificate/keychain files are cleaned up even after failure. The `release-evidence` workflow artifact retains the gate report, render evidence, packaging log, and any completed release record/checksums.

## Manual Mac acceptance

Record commit, version/build, OS, and results. Test macOS 14 and the current supported macOS on Apple silicon:

- Fresh offline install: every selected starter, create copy, open, Recents, and local template discovery.
- Install an unpacked external template; confirm categories and selection update when it is removed. Invalid packages report local issues without hiding valid templates.
- Type then close, reorder rows, commit IME, and quit with multiple documents.
- Failed save retains ownership; retry works and cancelled quit preserves other documents.
- Kill WebContent, reopen saved state, and continue editing.
- PNG/PDF, Finder preview/icon, keyboard focus, narrow windows, repeated open/close, and menu commands.
- GitHub and Discord remain in the native sidebar; Discord remains disabled until its URL is configured.
- Gatekeeper launch from downloaded DMG and ZIP; installed helper works without Node/Bun.
- Sparkle update from the previous signed release, verifying publisher and resulting version.

Use a disposable Release validation build to verify representative Analytics events and a symbolicated Crashlytics test crash outside the debugger. Relaunch after the crash for upload. Debug/tests do not upload telemetry. Do not ship a crash trigger. Retain the Release dSYM upload phase and verify reported version/build. Unit tests do not prove Firebase delivery.

## Publish the tested npm artifacts

`bun run packages:pack` writes tarballs under `generated/v1/npm`. `bun run test:packed --native` installs those exact artifacts into a temporary directory with spaces and verifies initialization, authoring, registration, themes, exports, preview resources, and durable installed skill links after package-cache removal. It derives versions from package manifests. Consumer-only overrides connect unpublished tarballs; shipped manifests contain registry versions, never workspace/file dependencies.

Keep the tested artifacts from the release commit. Confirm package versions/dependency pins and runtime provenance agree, and make the compatible signed Mac app available first. Download the three npm tarballs, `SHA256SUMS`, and `release-record.json` from the matching GitHub Release. Verify each tarball against its checksum and confirm the record identifies the tagged commit. The workflow retains the exact artifacts exercised by `test:packed --native`; do not repack them locally. It also archives the sealed runtime and ledger for future compatibility checks.

Authenticate locally with `npm login --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org`, then check the account with `npm whoami`. Keep credentials in your user configuration outside the repository. Publication may require an interactive 2FA challenge; Bun supports browser authentication and `--otp` for supported OTP challenges. See [npm authentication](https://docs.npmjs.com/accessing-npm-using-2fa/) and [Bun publishing](https://bun.sh/docs/pm/cli/publish). Never put tokens or OTPs in Git.

Publish the downloaded files in order (substitute the tested version and download directory):

```sh
bun publish ./generated/v1/npm/hitslop-schema-VERSION.tgz --access public
bun publish ./generated/v1/npm/hitslop-document-VERSION.tgz --access public
bun publish ./generated/v1/npm/hitslop-cli-VERSION.tgz --access public
```

Wait for each package to be available before publishing dependents. Never overwrite a published version or rebuild a different artifact between verification and publication. If publication partially succeeds, inspect registry state and resume only the missing packages; do not blindly replay the sequence.

From a fresh directory, verify `bunx @hitslop/cli@VERSION init smoke`, install the generated project, and run check/dev/build/register with the compatible Mac app. Separately verify `bun install -g @hitslop/cli@VERSION` and the `slop` entry point. Confirm the default `bunx @hitslop/cli` resolves to the intended launch release. Record artifact checksums and smoke results with the release record. Packing, tests, and this cleanup never publish automatically.
