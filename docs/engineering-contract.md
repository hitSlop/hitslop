# Engineering contract

Read manifest.json first. Only runtime `hitslop-v1` is accepted. No legacy-format migration. Preserve all shipped v1 runtime contracts; see docs/versioning.md.

- The live document is Loro in the WebView. Swift stores opaque checkpoint/update bytes in state/document.sqlite (format 1).
- One OS writer lock owns a local package. CLI commands route to the live native session or acquire ownership when closed. Never bypass a busy lock or unlink writer.lock.
- Author schema.ts with defineDocument/s from @hitslop/document. state.schema.json is a descriptor, not JSON Schema. initial.json is immutable creation-only data.
- App state uses text/rich text, finite scalar registers (including bounded integers), enums, objects, movable object/scalar lists, records, counters, trees, and optional values (scalar lists use an empty list). $id is row/tree identity. Read immutable snapshots; write typed fields or doc.at(snapshot) handles and synchronous change(tx => ...); transaction remains a compatibility alias. Initialize absent composites with set/put; never assign over existing identity-bearing collections, including through a containing object.
- Never add stores/data.json, persistent JSON mirrors, watchers for JSON reconciliation, a JavaScriptCore document engine, compatibility lenses, or a second document engine. Explicit one-shot JSON import is supported: the shared document runtime translates destination-shaped values into staged operations, preserves matching identities, and checks a destination version before replacement.
- Host and CLI ship matching runtimes per supported contract. App bundles must not embed Loro or the document implementation. slop dev uses the same runtime with disposable memory storage.
- Keep TypeBox authoritative for platform manifest/bridge contracts. Generate native contracts with bun run schema:generate; do not edit generated files.
- Runtime packages contain manifest.json, app.html, assets/, state.schema.json, initial.json, optional QuickLook images and embedded .agents/skills/hitslop-document guidance. Builds contain no state, stores, source, dependencies or caches.
- Preserve the existing macOS client: TCA Features, Catalog, Host slop windows/hover toolbar, Firebase Analytics/Crashlytics, Sparkle, and NativeCLI. HitSlopWasm supplies the common document engine; HitSlopRuntime integrates it. A runtime rewrite must not replace the client.
- Flush local drafts and document writes before close/export. Failed saves retain ownership and show native retry. Destroy WebViews on close.
- Native code validates package isolation, symlinks, bridge envelopes and resource sizes. Authored code can damage its own document; no independent native semantic validator.
- Active examples are discovered from immediate manifest-bearing directories under examples/slops; bundled.json selects shipped templates. Quick Checklist and Small Expenses remain regression fixtures. Each owns its design; use plain CSS and defineTheme tokens. Read examples/slops/PRODUCT.md and docs/guides/authoring.md for visual changes. _vibe is inspiration only.
- CLI: bun slop dev/build/register SOURCE; schema/get/apply/batch/import/compact DOCUMENT. get --snapshot includes a replacement version. import creates from an immutable template or explicitly replaces a version-checked writable document. Runtime masters are immutable; create a writable copy to edit.
- PDF/PNG export is in scope. Collaboration, audio-library import, remote catalog cutover, hosted template publication, undo UI, schema evolution, history pruning, iCloud and other synced folders are deferred.

- The native Swift CLI edits through the live Unix socket or an engine-only invisible WebKit session. Installed editing needs no Node/Bun. Never load authored app code for headless document operations.
- Catalog discovery combines bundled slops and ~/.hitslop/templates, with manifest-derived categories and Recents. Users unpack external downloads before placing template packages in that folder. Hosted discovery, OpenAPI/Registry, accounts/Auth/App Check, and sharing code live in deferred; Firebase Analytics/Crashlytics stay active.

- Launch includes compatible npm schema/document/CLI packages, published manually after the compatible signed Mac app. CLI versions may advance independently while their exact SDK dependency pins and runtime identity remain compatible. Hosted template publication remains deferred. See docs/guides/releasing.md.

- Reusable attachments are in scope: host-owned immutable blobs in state/attachments, referenced by ordinary Loro fields. Use @hitslop/document/attachments or the native attachment CLI. HTTPS data/media access is allowed; CORS still applies.
- Initial release baseline: contract 1/revision 1/SDK 1.0.0. Preserve sealed runtime bytes and ledger records; subsequent releases follow docs/versioning.md.
